                <h1>Q. What personality traits does this Big Five test measure?</h1>
                
                <p>The Big Five personality test measures the five personality factors that psychologists have determined are core to our personality makeup. The Five Factors of personality are:<br>

                  -Openness - How open a person is to new ideas and experiences<br>
                  -Conscientiousness - How goal-directed, persistent, and organized a person is<br>
                  -Extraversion - How much a person is energized by the outside world<br>
                  -Agreeableness - How much a person puts others' interests and needs ahead of their own<br>
                  -Neuroticism - How sensitive a person is to stress and negative emotional triggers<br>
                  The Big Five model of personality is widely considered to be the most scientifically robust way to describe personality differences. It is the basis of most modern personality research.</p>

                <p>A. This test has been researched extensively to ensure it is valid and reliable. It is based on psychological research into the core of personality, and our own psychometric research. Your scores show you how you compare to the other people in a large, international sample for each of the Big Five personality traits.</p>

                <h1>Q. What is the difference between Big Five, Five Factor, and the OCEAN model of personality?</h1>
                
                <p>A. Big Five, Five Factor, and OCEAN are all ways of describing the same theory of personality. Multiple psychological studies have arrived at the conclusion that the differences between people's personalities can be organized into five broad categories, called the Big Five or Five Factors. These are sometimes referred to as the five broad dimensions of personality.</p>
